# Weather-Prediction
This is a simple GUI application built with tkinter for predicting weather conditions using a Random Forest classifier.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:--> 
1. Python 3 
2. pandas 
3. scikit-learn 
4. tkinter.

## You can install pandas, scikit-learn, and tkinter using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

## Running the Application
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the Python script: "python weather_prediction_gui.py"
4. The GUI window will open, allowing you to input weather data and make predictions.

## How it Works
The application takes input data for various weather parameters such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, etc., and uses a pre-trained Random Forest classifier to predict the weather condition.

## Files
1. weather_prediction_gui.py: Python script containing the code for the tkinter GUI.
2. random_forest_model.joblib: Pre-trained Random Forest classifier model.

## Usage
1. Input the weather parameters into the corresponding entry fields.
2. Click the "Predict" button.
3. The predicted weather condition will be displayed.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the need for simple and accessible weather prediction tools.
